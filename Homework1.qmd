## What do you think being a data scientist is about?

Using data to help make informed decisions and derive insights.

## What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?

Other than salary and title? Officially, a data scientist combines computer science with statistics. But statisticians also program nowadays. The type of problems they work on could also be different. But in the end both are very similar with many overlapping skills.

## How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

Still a work in progress. That's what school is for. Currently working on the follow:

(markdown list)

1.  Learning Python
2.  Learning SQL
3.  More stat classes to expand domain knowledge

Code Chunk of y. Determining class, type, and structure of y.

```{r}
y <- density(iris$Petal.Width)
class(y)
typeof(y)
str(y)
```

Plot of Y

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(y)
```
