    "text": "What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?\nOther than salary and title? Officially, a data scientist combines computer science with statistics. But statisticians also program nowadays. The type of problems they work on could also be different. But in the end both are very similar with many overlapping skills."
